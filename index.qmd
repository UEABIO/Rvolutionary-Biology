Hi, I'm Phil! 

I am a molecular biologist interested in developing and testing gene drives and other genetic technologies to control pest insect species.

Currently based at the University of East Anglia I teach across a range of subjects including molecular biology, genetics, statistics and computing skills.

On this site you can find information on my research, current projects, and find details about teaching and outreach projects. <!-- ::: -->
