    "text": "The Biology department at the University of East Anglia (UEA) is developing R into teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. As big data and complex analysis skills become more mainstream across all biological disciplines (from multi-omics to complex ecological datasets), biology students need to have skills in computer programming and data analysis. The curriculum now prioritises the essential analytical skills in “data science”, including developing programming skills, data visualisation techniques, data wrangling, and creating reproducible reports. Providing students with the data handling tools to problem solve across various biological disciplines and beyond. This website is a repository for the open materials used in teaching reproducible research within the Biology department at UEA. For access to open data and code, please visit our GitHub page."
